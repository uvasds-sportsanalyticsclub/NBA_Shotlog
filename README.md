- There are over 210,000 shots in the data although there is a small number of shots with missing coordinates. 
- The data does not include free throws or shots where the shooter was fouled and missed.
- The x-axis variable (this is the sideline) ranges from 0 to 993, while the y-axis variable (this is the baseline) runs from 0 to 500.
- You can find the coordinates for the rim by looking for plays classified as a "Dunk". This might be useful for calculating distance of a shot.
- The dimensions of an NBA court are 94 feet by 50 feet.
